# Metro-Implementation
My C program simulates a metro system by modeling stations, routes, and metro lines using an adjacency matrix and data structures. It provides functionalities for:

1. Finding Routes: Uses Depth-First Search (DFS) to find all possible routes between two stations, along with the associated travel cost.
2. Displaying Station Details: Shows which metro lines a station belongs to and its adjacent stations.
3. Identifying Intersections: Lists stations that serve multiple metro lines.
4. Terminal Stations: Displays the first and last stations for each metro line.
5. Finding Nearest Intersections: Uses Breadth-First Search (BFS) to determine the closest station that connects multiple lines.
6. Dynamic Input Handling: Allows users to enter station names, metro lines, and fare costs dynamically.

Uses Adjacency matrix as Data Structure
